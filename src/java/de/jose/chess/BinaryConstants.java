Binary Representation of Move Data
----------------------------------

Move and annotation data are stored as a sequence of bytes, terminated by 0xff.
The data is stored in the database column Game.GameText.

A halfmove is identified by
- the moving piece (a-pawn to h-pawn, queen's knigth, king's knight etc.)
- an offset that indicates the direction of the move (see 2. Move Offsets)

Promotion moves and moves by promoted pieces are encoded by TWO bytes.

This encoding was chosen to encode most moves with one byte.



1. Byte Codes

0x00 .. 0x03	move of the a-pawn (see 2.1)
0x04 .. 0x07	move of the b-pawn (see 2.1)
0x08 .. 0x0b	move of the c-pawn (see 2.1)
0x0c .. 0x0f	move of the d-pawn (see 2.1)
0x10 .. 0x13	move of the e-pawn (see 2.1)
0x14 .. 0x17	move of the f-pawn (see 2.1)
0x18 .. 0x1b	move of the g-pawn (see 2.1)
0x1c .. 0x1f	move of the h-pawn (see 2.1)

0x20 .. 0x27	move of the queen's knight (see 2.2)
0x28 .. 0x2f	move of the king's knight (see 2.2)

0x30 .. 0x3f	move of the queen's bishop (see 2.3)
0x40 .. 0x4f	move of the king's bishop (see 2.3)

0x50 .. 0x5f	move of the queen's rook (see 2.4)
0x60 .. 0x6f	move of the king's rook (see 2.4)

0x70 .. 0x8f	move of the queen (see 2.5)
0x90 .. 0x97	move of the king (see 2.6)

0x98			kingside castling
0x99			queenside castling

0x9a .. 0x9f	reserved

				additional data is stored in second byte  (see 2.8)
0xa9 [+]		promoted piece move: "b" promotion piece
0xaa [+]		promoted piece move: "c" promotion piece
0xab [+]		promoted piece move: "d" promotion piece
0xac [+]		promoted piece move: "e" promotion piece
0xad [+]		promoted piece move: "f" promotion piece
0xae [+]		promoted piece move: "g" promotion piece
0xaf [+]		promoted piece move: "h" promotion piece

0xb0 [+]		annotation
				NAG code stored in second byte

0xb1 .. 0xcf	annotation (NAG codes 1 to 31)

0xd0			result: black wins
0xd1			result: draw
0xd2			result: white wins
0xd3			result unknown

0xd4 .. 0xdf	reserved

0xe0 [+]		text comment
				followed by text data (see 3.)

0xe1 [+]		error: move not readable				followed by text data
0xe2 [+]		error: illegal move     				followed by text data
0xe3 [+]		error: ambiguous move					followed by text data
0xe4 [+]		error: unrecgonized input   			followed by text data

0xe5 .. 0xef	reserved

0xf0			start of variation:
				following move data is a variation to the previous move
0xf1			end of variation

0xf2 .. 0xfe	reserved

0xff			end of data

3. Encoding of text data

Comment text is stored as a sequence of bytes, terminated by 0x00

| b1 | b2 | ... | 0x00 |

characters are currently encoded in ISO-8859-1
but UTF-8 would be better
